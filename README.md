This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for my research project, where I analysed the demographic distribution of survey participants and conducted correlation analysis on Likert-type questions related to the impact of the University of Sheffield's social media presence.

## 🗞️Dissertation Topic

This project is an extension of my dissertation, where I delved into the intricacies of public relations practices in higher education institutions, with a specific focus on the University of Sheffield. In today's digital age, social media plays a pivotal role in shaping the perception of academic institutions. I explored how the university strategically employs social media platforms for public relations, its impact on the university's image, and the level of engagement it fosters with various stakeholders. By conducting demographic analysis and correlation studies, this research sheds light on the dynamic interplay between social media and the public relations landscape in the higher education sector.
